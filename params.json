In this project, I achieved 97 success to reach the destination out of 100 trials.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nThis project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted\r\n) library installed\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nTemplate code is provided in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`. Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the `images` folder. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality for the `LearningAgent` class in `agent.py` when requested to successfully complete the project. \r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nIn a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:\r\n1) - As for the execute basic agent1 to random action\r\n   - change to the directory 'basic_agent' then excute following line.\r\n```python smartcab/agent1.py```  \r\n```python -m smartcab.agent1```\r\n2) - As for the execute basic agent2 to simple planner \r\n   - change to the directory 'basic_agent' then excute following line.\r\n```python smartcab/agent2.py```  \r\n```python -m smartcab.agent2```\r\n3) - As for the execute agent.py  to Q learning agent\r\n   - change to the directory 'qlearning_agent' then excute following line.\r\n```python smartcab/agent.py```  \r\n```python -m smartcab.agent```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will run the `agent.py` file and execute your agent code.\r\n",
