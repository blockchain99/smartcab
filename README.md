## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Code

Template code is provided in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`. Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the `images` folder. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality for the `LearningAgent` class in `agent.py` when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
1) - As for the execute basic agent1 to random action
   - change to the directory 'basic_agent' then excute following line.
```python smartcab/agent1.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent1```
2) - As for the execute basic agent2 to simple planner 
   - change to the directory 'basic_agent' then excute following line.
```python smartcab/agent2.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent2```
3) - As for the execute agent.py  to Q learning agent
   - change to the directory 'qlearning_agent' then excute following line.
```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```


This will run the `agent.py` file and execute your agent code.
